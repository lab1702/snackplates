# SnackPlates

The simplest threat plates addon for World of Warcraft

* Blue = Tanked by another tank
* Purple = On the way to take aggro from another tank
* Green = Tanking
* Yellow = On the way to lose aggro
* Orange = On the way to take aggro
* Red = Not tanking

For non-tanks the order of the colors is reversed except there is no blue or purple.

When you are not in combat, or not on threat table, bars are colored by reaction, dark gray if you can't tap the NPC.
